# Neovim

- Autocompletion doesn't work. I can't see the methods defined on an object or the arguments that methods expects.
- Format on save. Currently not working. Best i have is `gq` mapping.


# tmux

- when I paste something into neovim / tmux (leaning towrads tmux since pastinging alacritty w/o tmux running it works) neovim becomes unusable and it simplly starts writing a bunch of escape sequences
