# important

1. Change keymap for go to definition
2. Code folding - right now doesn't work
3. Configure format on save - I kind of have this working, but don't totally understand how it works - I'm assuming it just picks up a formatter if it's installed - or somehow uses LSPs formattin?

4. Configure telescope to show ceratin hidden files and not others - probably best way to do this is have it respect .gitignore
5. cmd + T in vscode lets you do a symbol search - does neovim have something similar?
6. Nice to have something space followed by tab to to the last file I visited


# nice to have

1. installed nvim-treesitter-context - need to look into configuration
2. <SPC-TAB> would return me to the last file that I visited












# notes


## Understanding Neovim #1 - Installation

- help command appears 4 times on the welcome text
- I have to know how to use the help pages

- there is a distinction from the functions you can call from lua from scripts and onces that you can call from `:` thing - one is vimscript the other is lua
    - 

"since we are using a vimscript function we are going to use a vimscript command"

vim.opt.splitbelow = opens below
vim.opt.splitright -> vertical splits open to the right
