Right now all this is is part of my dotfiles migrated to home-manager. 


If I'm going to set this up on a brand new laptop I need to do this


1. install nix
2. clone this repo in `.config/home-manager` (possibly with `nix-shell -p git --run git clone <this-github-repo>`)
3. install home manager? (maybe with `nix-shell` again or whatever offical installation)
4. finally running `home-manager switch` should reproduce the exact same environment everywhere I use it on any computer.
